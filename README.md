# PicoW

Super simple terminal based text editor with Windows idioms. Think Notepad in Windows Terminal.

It is inteded for Windows users starting to master command line, who want to feel like home a little longer.

PicoW started as a hobby project to learn Rust, and very likely stays that way.

PicoW has nothing to do with UNIX [pico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_(text_editor)) editor.
The name suggests its minimal feature set, W stands for Windows.
